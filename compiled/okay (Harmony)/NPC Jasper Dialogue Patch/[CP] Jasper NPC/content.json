He's a hot-headed fanatic, and I've heard rumors that he's gone off into the caves following a 'white rabbit' - and, in all likelihood, got himself killed. Despite what I'm sure he's told you (since we parted rather unamicably), I've never wished harm upon him. But then again... he was always a bit of a stubborn fool, and never inclined to leave well alone what should be left alone!^I'm sorry, this isn't a threat! It's merely an expression of concern. Please, if you've found him - alive or dead - I'd appreciate you letting me know.
