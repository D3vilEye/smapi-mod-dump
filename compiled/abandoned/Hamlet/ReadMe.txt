Hamlet MOD
by Taskmaster


This silly little MOD is part of a Halloween contest to add some "spookiness" to Stardew Valley.  This MOD displays a candle and skull on the bottom left or right
edge of the screen.  It is designed to not block too much of the view, but still add some ambience.


Configuration
-------------
There is one adjustable option in the config.json file that will be created upon first run.  This options is explained in detail below:

DisplayOnLeft	- Set this value to true, default, to display the graphic on the left edge of the screem, otherwise false for the right edge.


History
-------
v1.0.0     - Initial Release


Conclusion
----------
If you like this MOD you might want to check out my "Junk Mail" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4452/) or my Monthly Mail mod 
(https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4523) for more silly and zany fun.

If you are a Steam user, I have created two Community Guides that you might enjoy.  They are not your typical regurgitation of the Stardew Valley Wiki,
but are short stories based on the game designed to add "lore" to the game experience.  Folks seem to enjoy them and I am sure you will too.
