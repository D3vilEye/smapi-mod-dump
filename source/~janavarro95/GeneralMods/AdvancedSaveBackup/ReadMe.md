**Save Backup** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which automatically backs up
your save files before you play and every in-game night.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Installation
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/435).

## Usage

configure that.
