Custom_NCP_Plus_Shop v 1.0.0

Posted on 5/8/16 at 8:46 P.M.

This is an example mod of how to create and bind a Custom Shop to an NPC. The source code for this mod can be used and simply altered to create your own merchant shop, and is heavily recommended that you just copy paste the source to save yourself a headache.

The custom shop bound to the NPC in the example will only launce once the NPC has gone though all of it's dialogue. There are other ways to launch it, but this was the simplest for me.

Remember that this mod is an example/template. Use the Class.cs as a starting point for making a new merchant NPC.

If you wish to make your NPC more complex and such feel free, but this is where I'm satisfied.

Here is the documentation for how to call the custom shop with full functionality.

Custom_Shop_Mod_Redux.Class1.external_shop_file_call(path, filename, shop_chat, myNPC);
  
Where

(string)path=path to the folder where the shop is stored.

(string)filename= the name of the shop file. Ex "MyShop.txt"

(string)shop_chat= the dialogue the npc says while in the shop.

(NPC)myNPC= the NPC that the shop uses as the base for the portrait.
