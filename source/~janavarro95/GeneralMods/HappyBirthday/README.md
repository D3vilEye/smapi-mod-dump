**Happy Birthday** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you pick a day
for your birthday. On your birthday, you get letters from your parents, and villagers give you
gifts and wish you happy birthday.

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.2+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

## Installation
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/releases).

## Usage
The menu to choose your birthday should appear when you wake up in the morning. On your birthday,
