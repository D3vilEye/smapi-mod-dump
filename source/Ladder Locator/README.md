----

This mod for Stardew Valley will mark the stones which will spawn a ladder or shaft to a lower level. If you can't see any marking it simply means you have bad luck and no stone will generate a ladder or shaft. Just clear some stones until the RNG is in your favor and the marks will eventually appear.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3094).
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Compatibility
* Works with Stardew Valley 1.4 on Linux/Mac/Windows.
