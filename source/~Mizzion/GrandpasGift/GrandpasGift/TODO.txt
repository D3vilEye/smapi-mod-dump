Things that need to be done

1. Add  Grandpa's message to the player based on the Farm they chose.
2. Add the items that Grandpa gives to the player. (May be universal items, or based on Farm Map....unsure yet).
3 Add in the buffs that will be given to the player based on Farm Map.
4. I'm sure I'll come up with more......
