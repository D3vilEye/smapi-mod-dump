Speeder's Combat with Farming Implements
========================================
 
This is a fairly simple mod for the game [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/), it allows you to actually fight with farming tools.

![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The game allows you to damage enemies with farming tools, but even right on the start of the game the damage they do is useless.

Also farming tools take valuable inventory space, this is an attempt to make them useable for combat, without making proper weapons obsolete.
