If you play the game without the steam overlay and have missed unlocking achievements on steam, install this mod.
The first time you load the game with this mod, it will scan all your achievements and unlock them on steam.
You'll know if worked if you here the achievement chime (and more importantly if you go to your steam page and see the achievements have been updated.
After that you can safely delete the mod (until you need it again).
