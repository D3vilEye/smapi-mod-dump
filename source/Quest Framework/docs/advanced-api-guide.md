# Advanced API guide

aka mod api for use in SMAPI mods (written in C#)

## Installation

1. Download Quest Framework from [Nexusmods](todo)
2. Copy contents of ZIP file to the mods folder in StardewValley folder
3. Create new SMAPI mod with VisualStudio
4. Reference QuestFramework dll in your project references (from the SDV mods folder)

### How to use

You can access Quest Framework API via [SMAPI's mod API provider](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/APIs/Integrations#Using_an_API)

```csharp
using QuestFramework.API
using StardewModdingAPI;

class ModEntry : Mod
{
    public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
    {
        helper.Events.GameLoop.GameLaunched += this.OnGameStarted;
    }
  
    private void OnGameStarted(object sender, GameLaunchedEventArgs e)
    {
        IQuestApi api = this.Helper.ModRegistry.GetApi<IQuestApi>("PurrplingCat.QuestFramework");
        IManagedQuestApi managedApi = api.GetManagedApi(this.ModManifest);
        
        api.Events.GettingReady += (_sender, _e) => {
            managedApi.RegisterQuest(/* enter quest definition here */);
        };
    }
}
```

## API Overview

### Mod-provided API

All mod-provided Quest Framework APIs is in namespace `QuestFramework.API`

**IQuestApi** interface

### Events API

```csharp
namespace QuestFramework.Events
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Events of Quest Framework
    /// </summary>
    public interface IQuestFrameworkEvents
    {
        /// <summary>

        /// <summary>
        /// Quest log menu was closed
        /// </summary>
        event EventHandler<EventArgs> QuestLogMenuClosed;
        
        /// <summary>
        /// Managed questlog and/or offers was refreshed
        /// </summary>
        event EventHandler<EventArgs> Refreshed;
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle

1. `DISABLED`
Before onGameLaunched and when QF's Entry() method called
2. `STANDBY`
After onGameLaunched
**Register hook observers here**
3. `AWAITING`
Only in multiplayer and on client-side. Waiting for init message
4. `LAUNCHING`
On game loaded (and init message received in multiplayer on client-side) 
**Register your quests, offers and assign hooks on quests here**
5. `LAUNCHED`
Game loaded and all Quest Framework stuff initialized
6. `CLEANING` 
Returning to title screen. Next state is *STANDBY*.
**Clean your specialized custom stuff with QF here**

## Work with quests

### Add custom quest

```cs
var quest = new CustomQuest();

quest.Name = "meet_marlon"; // This is important!
quest.BaseType = QuestType.Location
quest.Title = "Meet with Marlon";
quest.Description = "Enter the Adventurer Guild east of mines and meet with Marlon.";
quest.Objective = "Go to Adventurer Guild";
quest.Trigger = "AdventureGuild";
quest.Cancelable = true; // Set this if you want this quest cancelable
quest.Reward = 500; // Set this if you want to set money reward (50g in this example quest)

// If you want to set next quests which will be added after this quest was completed
// These quests must be registered too in Quest Framework quest manager!
quest.NextQuests.Add("slay_bats");
quest.NextQuests.Add("bat_wing_trophy");
```
