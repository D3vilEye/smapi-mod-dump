# TreeShaker
SMAPI mod to gather seeds from trees automatically

Place a Chest to the right of the mailbox (the location can also be changed in the config)
and every morning the mod will shake the seeds from all of your trees and also pick up the ones on the ground.
to disable just remove the chest.
