# Speeder's Sprint and Dash buttons mod
 
This is a fairly simple mod for the game [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/), it adds a sprint button and a dash button.

The buttons are configurable in a json file, they default to "Control" to sprint, and "N" to dash

Sprint makes your character run slightly faster, but costing a bit of energy per second, it is intended to move faster around the world when you don't own a horse yet.

Dash makes your character dash very fast, it also do lots of damage, and becomes more resilient for the very short time of the dash, but it costs lots of energy, has a long cooldown, and the dash power depends on your skills.
