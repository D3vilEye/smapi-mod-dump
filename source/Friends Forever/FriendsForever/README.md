## Notice

I am currently too busy to work on/release many of these mods. I welcome anyone
to take them (especially the unreleased ones!).

## Configuration:
There are only four different true/false options in config.json:

* AffectSpouses: Whether spouses will be prevented from experiencing friendship
decay.
* AffectDates: Whether dates will be prevented from experiencing friendship decay.
Dates are anyone you have given a bouquote to and you are still unmarried.
* AffectEveryoneElse: Whether everyone else will be prevented from experiencing
friendship decay. If you are married, this includes people you could be dating.
* AffectAnimals: Whether farm animals are prevented from experiencing friendship
decay. They will still lose friendship if you leave them outside or forget to
feed them.
