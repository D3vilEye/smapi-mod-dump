My SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley

## Released

  A highly configurable overhaul for Stardew Valley's tree growth.
  It adds new mechanics and fixes bugs, in addition to allowing thorough customisation of the vanilla mechanics.

## Unreleased
* **[Modding Tools](/Phrasefable%20Modding%20Tools)**<br />
  A bunch of console commands I use to help development.

* ~~[No Ore](/NoOre)~~<br/>
  Unfunctional.
