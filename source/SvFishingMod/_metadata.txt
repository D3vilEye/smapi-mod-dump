       Bite Delay removal and SMAPI Settings
       
       + Added `sv_fishing_bitedelay` option for toggling on/off the random bite delay after the line has been thrown.
       + Ability to remove the Bite Delay after the rod has been thrown.
       - Switched to SMAPI managed settings using JSON files, instead of manual XML serialization.
       - Bumped mod version to 0.1.2.
       - Updated README.md with the new `sv_fishing_bitedelay` command help.
       - Minor code cleanup
