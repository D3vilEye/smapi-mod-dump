### Goodbye American English ###

Changes American spelling to British spelling, this includes changing the season fall to autumn.

Also changes the game units to the metric system

I've tried to be as thorough as I can but I may have missed some changes, let me know if you spot anything and I'll fix it up.

## To install: ##
