[i]a [url=http://stardewvalley.net/]Stardew Valley[/url] mod by [url=https://kdau.gitlab.io]kdau[/url][/i]

It's little! It's lovely! It shows Livin' Off The Land! The Portable TV is a craftable item carried in your inventory that lets you watch TV channels (standard and custom) from anywhere in Stardew Valley.

This version of Portable TV is compatible with [b]Stardew Valley 1.4+[/b].

This mod should work on [b]Linux, macOS, Windows and Android[/b]. On Android, the sounds when the TV turns on and off are not supported.

There are no known problems with multiplayer use. Every player should install the mod, even if they are not using the Portable TV.

There are no known conflicts with other mods. Custom TV channels should display fine alongside the standard ones.

The Portable TV is a resource item that can be carried in your inventory. Its crafting recipe is available immediately and requires a Gold Bar, 2 Refined Quartz and a Battery Pack.

To use the TV on Linux, macOS or Windows, select it in your inventory and right-click in an open part of the world. You can press "R" on your keyboard (or another key that you configure; see below) to activate any Portable TV in your inventory.

To use the TV on Android, select it in your inventory and tap anywhere in the world. You can also configure the Virtual Keyboard mod to add an "R" button; tapping it will activate any Portable TV in your inventory.

The farmer will pick up the TV and turn it on, showing the familiar channel list. After you have viewed your chosen program, the farmer will turn off the TV and put it away. Just use it again to watch something else.
