       3.0.0 Branch + Horse Updates
       
       - Updates for 3.0.0 compat
       - WildHorses can now notify whether they appear and/or where they appear (rather than requiring both at once)
       - WildHorse spawn locations can now be customized (adding additional options will bug out- SDV does not like them to be in certain places)
       - Beginnings of Horse ownership implemented into the coding.
