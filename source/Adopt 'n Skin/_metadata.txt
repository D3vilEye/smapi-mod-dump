       Updates for SDV 1.5
       
       Updated to SMAPI 3.8.0 and SDV 1.5
       
       - Hover box and interaction code has been changed to use SDV's new version of the functions for sprite positions. This seems to be the only change necessary at the moment.
       - One-line hotfix attempt for errors in MP, where farmhands receive error code when a stray or wild horse spawns
