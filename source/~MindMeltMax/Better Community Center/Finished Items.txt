Vault accepts gold and allows withdrawal.

Kitchen works, Pantry recieves random donations which can be tracked from the 
donation sheet. Donation sheet tracks player donations aswell, this is kind
of buggy as of now.

Crafts room has a working dye menu on the dye pots and loom is currently a
tailor menu, possibly change to normal loom?

Bulletin board now allows the player to request up to 3 diffrent items with max stack of 5, 
any item (including JA items) are requestable once they are shipped / found (archeology & minerals)
