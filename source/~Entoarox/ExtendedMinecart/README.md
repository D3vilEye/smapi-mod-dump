**Extended Minecart** adds new minecart destinations to the game, that function as both in and out
spots. 

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. [Install Entoarox Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2269).
3. [Install this mod from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2271).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
This mod adds new minecart destinations that function as both in and out spots. Some of these
destinations unlock immediately, while others have requirements (like the Quarry). As a side-effect
of having more places to go, the carts now have a small chance to run out of fuel and require you
to input 5 coal before you can use them again.

Made by request of Pathoschild as a somewhat Christmas gift, so share the thanks with him if you
