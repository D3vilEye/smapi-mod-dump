This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for
documentation and release notes.

Thanks to Advize, Alhifar, CJ A, CLxS and many others for helping me understand some of the

All copyright for unique code remains mine as of this time, as a citizen of the Netherlands, even
though the code is public to view.

Fellow stardew modders are welcome to learn from, make use of, and experiment with this code in the
creation of their own stardew mods!

Code provided by others is subject to their own copyright rights per dutch law, the only rights they
provide is its inclusion, modification as part of, and use in Stardew Valley mods.

### Inactivity disclaimer and permissions
In the event that I have not been active on the chucklefish forums, SDV developer discord or SDV
public discord for at least 30 days, I give permission for any willing SDV modder to fork, modify
and distribute code from this repository.

In the event a new SDV and/or SMAPI version is released that breaks compatibility of my mods, the
inactivity duration only needs to be 7 days for the above permission to be valid.

I ask that should I return after such a time, that the person who was kind enough to take over
maintenance of my mods return them to myself.
