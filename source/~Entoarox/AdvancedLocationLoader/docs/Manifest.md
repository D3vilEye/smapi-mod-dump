Content Pack Format
===================
Each ALL content pack must have two files:
* a `manifest.json` for SMAPI (see [Modding:Content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Content_packs));
* a `locations.json` which describes the location changes.

This `locations.json` contains the basic layouts for both custom locations and shops.
For a list of valid conditions that are usable in the various "Conditions" fields see [the Custom Condition System documentation](../../Framework/docs/conditions.md) over in the Entoarox Framework github.

To use a `Conditional` in your conditions, use the name of the conditional prefixed with `ALLCondition_`.

**Location Config (Version 1.2)**
```javascript
{
	/* What config loader ALL should use to load the file, for the 1.2 branch should always be `1.2` */
	"LoaderVersion":"1.2",
	/* The locations section is where new locations are registered for addition to the game */
	"Locations":[
		{
			/* The name to use for this new location in warps and such, if not unique then ALL will report a error */
			"MapName":"",
			/* The path to the xnb file, relative to this locations.json, of the tbin that contains the map for this location, without the xnb extension */
			"FileName":"",
			/* If set to `true` then this new location is a outdoor location and exhibits all behaviour outdoor locations have */
			"Outdoor":false,
			/* If set to `true` then this new location is a farmable location and crops will be able to be planted here */
			"Farmable":false,
			/* What special Type of location this is, or `Default` if a generic location, special location types have unique behaviour that no other location type exhibits */
			"Type":"Default"
			/*
				The following types are currently supported:
				Default			- Generic location
				Cellar			- Location where Cask objects are able to work
				Greenhouse		- Location that is not affected by seasons similar to the greenhouse
				Sewer			- Location that has the same green fog effect as the vanilla Sewer location
				BathHousePool	- Location that has the same white fog effect as the vanilla BathHousePool location
				Desert			- Location that exhibits the same 'always sunny' behaviour that the vanilla Desert exhibits
				Decoratable		- Location that allows for Furniture objects to be placed within

				More types may be added in the future, ALL will report if a type is unknown and fall back to the Default type in that case
