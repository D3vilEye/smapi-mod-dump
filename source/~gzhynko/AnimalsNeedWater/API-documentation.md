# API Documentation
**Animals Need Water** provides an API allowing modders to access data like *which animals were left thirsty yesterday* or *coops/barns with watered troughs*.

Here's what ANW's API interface looks like:
```csharp
    public interface IAnimalsNeedWaterAPI
    {
        List<AnimalLeftThirsty> GetAnimalsLeftThirstyYesterday();

        List<string> GetCoopsWithWateredTrough();
        List<string> GetBarnsWithWateredTrough();

        bool IsAnimalFull(string displayName);
        List<string> GetFullAnimals();
    }
```
