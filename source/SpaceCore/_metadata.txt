       Hopefully fix edge case with invisible pants.
       Pants 51-60 would be invisible due to being on the edge of the texture.
       The whole texture itself overlaps the end, but each portion that the
       game renders at once does not overlap. Since it doesn't overlap or go
       past the boundary, the rect wouldn't be adjusted. There was enough room
       on the vanilla texture left so that this left them invisible.
