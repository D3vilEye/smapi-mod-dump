## Fish Preview
Shows a preview of the fish species while you are catching it! Fish species you have caught before will show the preview; uncaught fish species show as "???" (configurable). Also works in other languages and with mods that add new fish.

## Show Item Quality
This mod shows star quality in the HUD pop-up when you harvest crops, collect animal products, gather forage, catch fish, and empty machines. The stack number will always update with the total number of recent items (regardless of quality); the quality star shown will match the most recent item picked up.
