# Giant Crop ring


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1182?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod adds a new ring item, using CustomElementHandler to handle custom items, and then performs a check every night if you have the ring equipped. If that passes, it simulates the game's giant crop growth code.
