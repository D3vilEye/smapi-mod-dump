# Safe Lightning


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2039?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

The mod uses Harmony to replace the lightning method that destroys items in the world with one that has all the visual effects without any of the destruction.
