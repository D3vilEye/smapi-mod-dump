# Pong


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1994?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

This mod is mainly a joke since you can't play the original game anymore, but also an exercise in object oriented design. It stops SDV from receiving any inputs and then draws over the screen to display the Pong game.
