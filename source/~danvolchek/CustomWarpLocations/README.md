# Custom Warp Locations


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1688?) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod hooks into the pending warp location that is created when you use an item, and overwrites it with a new location depending on the item that you're holding.
