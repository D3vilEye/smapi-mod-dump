# Customizable Death Penalty


See [This link](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1991) for the NexusMods mod page, which has a description, screenshots, and a download of the built mod.

## How it works

The mod saves the current state of fields that can be changed on death, and then after the game revives you it resets those fields according to the user's config file.
