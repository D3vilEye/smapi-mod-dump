[i]a [url=http://stardewvalley.net/]Stardew Valley[/url] mod by [url=https://kdau.gitlab.io]kdau[/url][/i]

Make blooms, not war. Craft a Flower Bomb, fill it with wild or flower seeds, and toss it on any dirt or grass in the Valley. The next morning youâ€™ll have an explosion of seasonal color.

Once you have two or more hearts of friendship with [b]Leah[/b], she will send you the Flower Bomb crafting recipe in the mail. (If you are married to her, she will teach you the recipe in an event in the farmhouse instead.) You can craft a Flower Bomb with [b]4 Clay and 1 Mudstone[/b].

For your convenience, [b]Clint[/b] will now sell a limited supply of Mudstone each day. If you have befriended [b]Kent[/b], he will now send you Flower Bombs in the mail instead of regular Bombs.

You can load any [b]wild or flower seeds[/b], including custom flower seeds, into a Flower Bomb the same way you would load Bait onto a fishing rod. You can unload seeds that way too. Empty Flower Bombs can stack in your inventory, but loaded Flower Bombs cannot.

You can place a Flower Bomb directly in the world on [b]any dirt or grass[/b]. To pick it up again, strike it with a tool. You can also load empty Flower Bombs into a Slingshot and fire them. If they land on or near dirt or grass, they will stick in that area.

All Flower Bombs in the world will [b]"detonate" overnight[/b]. If a Flower Bomb held in-season flower seeds, the explosion will consist mainly of that flower, with some seasonal wildflowers and weeds at the edges. If it held in-season wild seeds, the explosion will consist mainly of seasonal wildflowers with weeds at the edges. Otherwise, the explosion will consist entirely of weeds. (In winter, weeds are replaced with crystals.)
