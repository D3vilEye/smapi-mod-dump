       Added option to specify ObjectId instead of item Name in modded bag configs. This resolves ambiguities where certain items don't have unique names, such as "Stone" which could be Id=670, 668, 450, 390, 343 etc. Only intended to be used by items with static ids (Content patcher or vanilla items, but not JsonAsset items)
